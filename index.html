<h2>Who am I?</h2>
Hi I'm <b>Guoxing Lan(兰国兴）</b>! I'm currently an algorithm engineer at Huawei Consumer Business Group in Shanghai. I obtained my master's degree and bachelor's degree both from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. My interests are Machine Learning and Deep Learning theories and their applications especially in NLP(Natural Language Processing). Besides, I have some research experiences in data-driven fault diagnosis during my master study. I enjoy writing technical blogs, and I believe the best way to learning new knowledge is by explaining it clearly to other people. If you have any questions or any ideas to discuss with me, feel free to contact me by email(langx15 [AT] tsinghua.org.cn), or add my WeChat number(lankuohsing)</a>.
